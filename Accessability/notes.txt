Accessible Design; 

Text: 
    Use High contrast headings/text/backgrounds 
    Text color should have X times the luminance of its paired 
    darker color. 
    (Aim for 7:1 for AAA)
    Contrast should be to atleast 4.5:1.
    or 3:1 for larger (24px+ )text sizes, 
    Use     https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ 

Color: 
    Distinguish background and foreground colors 
    use contrasting colors of a color wheel 
    use color scheme with shades of brigness across single color. 
        (Think about it in greyscale)
    pair colour with other forms of conveying information
        (red ~ Error message / green ~  Success)

Use headings correctly;
    headings connote importance, not size. 

Use Real Text overlayed on images
(Rather than images with text);
    screen-readers transform text to voice 
    users can scale text 
    less taxing on browser to load text

Trends: 
    Text overlaid on images 
        Adding dark transparent layer over image boosts contrast
        Adding text-shadow boosts contrast too. 

    Removing Input Labels: 
        -low contrast bad for vision impaired
        -removal is bad for screen readers 

    Buttons/Links: 
        -minimalism sacrifices contrast 
        -colour alone is not enough to indicate clickability

Accessability: 

Semantic HTML:
    nav, header, main, etc 
    not 
    div, div, div, etc 

ARIA role: 
    Roles: https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-descendants-of-aria-roles 
    attribute role="xx" of an element. 
    perhaps its essential, complementary

    presentation: 
    -Screen reader will skip "ordered list" and all subsequent children elements. 
    ol role="presentation">
    li> Item 1 /li>
    /ol> 

ARIA properties: 
    Alternative text - a description of the image. 
    img src="#" alt="a painting of mona lisa"/>

    aria-label - gives screen reader additional information to read aloud 
        (visually we can infer that the name and image are related
        screen readers need extra help)
    p arial-label="Artist"> someone, 2010 /p>
