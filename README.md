# smallProjects
This repo seeks to achieve a personal goal ~ "Show off what as been learned from CodeCademy over 2022".

This repo will follow along with the relavant units set out by the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path of CodeCademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path)

I will create a variety of small projects showcasing what I've learned. 
This will consolidate my understanding of the project material, grow a respectable portfolio, and potentially even act as a source of reference for new learners.   

I will use the revised version of Bloom's Taxonomy (https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/#2001) as a guideline.
(Remember > Understand > Apply > Analyze > Evaluate > Create)

Which will improve the credability of my projects, showing that I fully understand the concepts displayed. 
Rather than simply CTRL+C, then CTRL+V someone else's work. 

I understand that within the standard of the software devleopment industry is developing reusable, modular solutions that have the very aim of being copied. 
However, if one simply copies without understanding, a simple 'fix' will lead to many, many bugs.
